    <p>The article "Case Study Research in Software Engineering: It is a Case and a Study, but Is it a Case Study?" by
        Runeson and HÃ¶st (2009) delves into applying case study methodologies within software engineering research.
    </p>
    <p>The authors emphasize the importance of case studies in understanding complex real-world phenomena in software
        development. </p>
    <p>They provide a comprehensive guide on designing, conducting, and reporting case studies,
        highlighting common pitfalls and best practices to ensure rigor and validity in research findings. The paper
        serves as a foundational reference for researchers aiming to employ case study methods effectively in software
        engineering.</p>
